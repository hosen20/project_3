Benchmarking â€“ Content
This folder contains datasets and quantum circuit definitions used for benchmarking quantum-inspired algorithms and Trotterized quantum simulations.

ðŸ“‚ Files Overview
1. analytical.npz
Type: NumPy compressed archive

Purpose: Stores precomputed analytical reference results for benchmarking.

Usage: Load with:

```
import numpy as np
data = np.load('analytical.npz')

```
Contents:  include analytical solutions, parameters, and expected values against which simulated or experimental results can be compared.
 Workflow Context
Analytical Baseline â†’ Provided by analytical.npz.

Quantum-Inspired Simulation Results â†’ Stored in quantum_inspired_results.npz.

Quantum Hardware/Simulator Execution â†’ Using the .qasm circuits for different Trotter step counts.

Benchmarking â†’ Compare all outputs to assess accuracy, scaling, and resource costs.
